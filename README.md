# Food Advisor

  This repo contains a streamlit application powered by LangChain.
  
  A foods.com recipes dataset is contained in a vector database hosted in Pinecone. The application allows the user to input human-language text explaining
  it's preferences, triggering an LLM to perform a query on the vector database, looking for the most suitable recipes.
